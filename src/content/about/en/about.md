*ta.permanence* is a long-term initiative to preserve the writings of workers in struggle, unpaid workers and workers in training whom we call students. Here, we highlight individuals writing on their own behalf and autonomous groups outside of union bureaucracy. The domain name will expire in 2099 and the website is static, so it costs almost nothing to host.
